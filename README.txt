# Info

If you want to be able to edit the .scala source files, install the nightly plug-in from 

http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/scala.update/

it only works with Eclipse 3.4 and above.  See https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/wiki/EclipsePlugin for more information.


If you don't to install the plug-in, after importing the plug-in also import the *scala.library.zip* file then MOOD metrics plug-in as an Eclipse Application.  This approached also worked with Eclipse 3.3.
